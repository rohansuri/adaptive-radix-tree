Largely from two places:

InnerNode.getLeaf
and LeafNode.getKey

And it is understandable why.
Both are the point of "first" accesses after reaching a node.
Meaning they are the first loads to be done on a node.
Hence naturally will incur a LLC miss.

One important point to note here is that in Tries the inner nodes don't have keys.
All n keys are stored in LeafNodes. All the structure other than that is just supporting
the access to leaf nodes. Whereas in RB tree every :
